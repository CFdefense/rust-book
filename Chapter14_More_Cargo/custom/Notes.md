## Chapter 14 – More About Cargo and Crates.io: Extending Cargo with Custom Commands

Cargo is designed so that you can extend it with new subcommands without having to modify it. 

If a binary in your `$PATH` is named **cargo-something**, you can run it as if it were a `Cargo` subcommand by running `cargo something`.

Custom commands like this are also listed when you run `cargo --list`.

 Being able to use cargo install to install extensions and then run them just like the built-in Cargo tools is a super-convenient benefit of Cargo’s design!
